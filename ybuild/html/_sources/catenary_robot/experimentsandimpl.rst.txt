Experiment 1.1: Track a trajectory where the catenary point :math:`\boldsymbol{\chi_c}` is driven to :math:`\boldsymbol{\chi_c}^d`, and then it remains static while
the span and yaw orientation oscillate. Demonstrate that
even when the robots are moving around, the lowest point will
remain at the same location once that this point is reached.
This experiment is performed in both simulation and actual
robots. 

Experiment 1.2: Test with different kinds of cables to demonstrate the effect of increasing the weight of the cable
Demonstrate that if the weight is big enough it affects the motion of the catenary robot and it is necessary to consider it in the model so the thrust compensates the extra force. 

Experiment 2: Define a trajectory of the catenary to move through obstacles that require accurate motion. 
Even though we do not have direct measurements of the curve, we are able to track a trajectory, 
based on the catenary trajectory tracking and tracking controller equations.

Experiment 3: Interact with and attach to an umbrella handle (an object with a naturally
hook-shaped attach point) by controlling the lowest point
o the catenary curve. 

Experiment 4: Design to transport a hook-shaped object achieved by a created
trajectory that allows the catenary robot to self-attach to the
object and lift it to take it to another place in the environment.
