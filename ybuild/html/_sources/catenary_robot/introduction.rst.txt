Transporting objects using aerial robots has been
widely studied in the literature. Still, those approaches always
assume that the connection between the quadrotor and the load
is made in a previous stage. However, that previous stage usually
requires human intervention, and autonomous procedures to
locate and attach the object are not considered. Additionally, most
of the approaches assume cables as rigid links, but manipulating
cables requires considering the state when the cables are hanging.
In this work, we design and control a catenary robot. Our robot
is able to transport hook-shaped objects in the environment. The
robotic system is composed of two quadrotors attached to the two
ends of a cable. By defining the catenary curve with five degrees
of freedom, position in 3-D, orientation in the z-axis, and span,
we can drive the two quadrotors to track a given trajectory.
We validate our approach with simulations and real robots. We
present four different scenarios of experiments. Our numerical
solution is computationally fast and can be executed in real-time.
